# Personal growth

We want you to grow with us. Here's the plan:


## Working cross-projects

We encourage you to work on areas that go besides your main area of responsibility.

**Example 1:** Jim, who started as BlackBerry developer moved to Android and later also to sysadmin.

**Example 2:** Josef, who started as Backend developer is now one of the main contributors in iOS app.


## Regular mentoring sessions

We teamed up with a large company full of experts who give us feedback in all important engineering areas.

Also some of our investors come from large tech-companies and give valuable feedback.


## Library

We order books from Amazon. The last arrivals include:

* [Building Scalable Web Sites: Building, Scaling, and Optimizing the Next Generation of Web Applications](http://goo.gl/VhKQ29)

## Online courses

We encourage you to learn as much possible and implement the best practices in one of our projects. You pick a training and we pay for it.


## English

If you're not fluent in English, you'll improve it quickly. We're a multi-national team and use EN in oral and written communication.
