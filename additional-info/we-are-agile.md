# We are agile

Not long time ago we adopted agile to speed up our product development and make it more transparent across the whole company.

## Kanban board

We use JIRA and Confluence to help us be agile. Check the iOS board on the screenshot.

## Stand-ups

Every day @ 12:50pm we have a stand-up meeting. Each of us highlights what he or she was working on A) yesterday, B) today and C) what's blocking them.

## Retrospective meetings

After each sprint we've got a retrospective meeting where we share insights about what went well and what to improve in the next sprint.

## Collaboration

Confluence helps us be more collaborative than ever before.
