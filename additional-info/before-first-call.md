## Can I just send you CV by email?

It's a good start, but it's not enough. Before we schedule a Skype call with you, we need you to fill all the required information in the form.
   
## Why do I need to do it?

Because we have particular questions and a simple CV usually doesn't answer them. That's why we need you to fill the application form.
