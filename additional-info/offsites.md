# Offsites

We organize offsites on a beach in [Hua Hin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hua_Hin_District). What a lovely working environment, right? :)

Last time we booked a [4-floor villa in Hua Hin](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/988395) and spent a full week working there. We started at 10am with Scrum's stand-up meeting and continued on a beach in the afternoon.

They had good food and beer on a beach, so we spent some time working there:

We were also working in the villa during the day...

...and sometimes until late night. Again, beer helped us fight against eyestrain :)
