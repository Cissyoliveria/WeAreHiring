#Before our first call

Please **[fill in this application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gGZYgjzAU0rUOCVOqQ_X7dd3x-u8DI8JBmX6QwuZD0k/viewform)** before our first call so that we can prepare for it properly.

* it is divided into 3 steps:
   * your name, email, telephone, URLs to your public profiles etc.
   * your portfolio - projects you've been working on
   * your skills relevant to the position you're applying for

## Can I just send you CV by email?

It's a good start, but it's not enough. Before we schedule a Skype call with you, we need you to fill all the required information in the form.
   
## Why do I need to do it?

Because we have particular questions and a simple CV usually doesn't answer them. That's why we need you to fill the application form.

## Need more info?

It's all [explained here](https://github.com/HotelQuickly/WeAreHiring/).
