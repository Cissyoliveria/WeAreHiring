# Contract details

We're a [BOI approved company](http://www.boi.go.th/index.php?page=index) here in Thailand, which means that in general we can get visas and work permits for people coming from abroad.

However, both work pemit and visa depends on the current BOI policy and rules. If applicant is 27 years old above and graduated in the same field that he is working, yes we can do that but i'm not 100% sure because we already got alot of expat in the system. If applicant is under 27 then we can still do a long term visa easily, but not the work permit.

Anyways, all you need is the visa. Work permit is nice-to-have.

## Tax system

Being employed in Thailand means paying 10% income tax for an example salary of 50.000 THB per month.
