# Contract details

We're a [BOI approved company](http://www.boi.go.th/index.php?page=index) here in Thailand, which means that in general we can get visas and work permits for people coming from abroad.

However, both work pemit and visa depends on the current BOI policy and rules. If you are 27 years old or above and graduated in the same field that you are about to work at HotelQuickly, then most likely we can arrange both for you. If you're under 27, then we can still arrange long term visa easily, but excluding the work permit.

Anyways, all you need is the visa. Work permit is nice-to-have.

## Tax system

Being employed in Thailand means paying 10% income tax for an example salary of 50.000 THB per month.
