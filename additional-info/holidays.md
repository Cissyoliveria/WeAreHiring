# Holidays

People are asking us about holidays. And we ask them back: *holi-what??*

We work a lot, coz we love what we are doing. Sometimes also on Saturday evening, sometimes during Thai public holidays... We're building a company here - what can be more exciting and interesting, right?

If you work hard like us, we're not counting your holidays. Take it whenever you need, just let us know in advance.

Oficially, there's some 20 days of holidays. But let's focus on getting things done, not holidays ;)
