### About us

[HotelQuickly](http://www.hotelquickly.com) is the #1 mobile app for same-day hotel booking in Asia-Pacific with great last-minute discounts. Our company was set up by experienced [international team](http://www.hotelquickly.com/about-us) comprising of serial entrepreneurs and investors. We launched across Asia in March 2013 with teams in Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, Indonesia and Malaysia. Now we're live in 12 countries across Asia-Pacific.

Recently we were featured on TechCrunch, CBS, NBC, e27, TechInAsia, TheNextWeb, Yahoo, Tnooz and [zillions of others](http://www.hotelquickly.com/press).

Oh, and we raised $4.5m USD in [last funding](http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/09/hotelquickly-raises-4-5-million-to-double-down-on-last-minute-hotel-booking-in-asia-pacific/). That makes it $5.6M in total. So let's help us make this company HUGE!

### The job and the challenges

For some of the projects we're about to initiate we need a project coordinator / business analyst.

These projects would allow you to take ownership of the project from start to finish. For the project you will have a dedicated team of two developers (internal and external freelance if needed), one designer and one localisation coordinator.

You will communicate with our inhouse business, marketing and social media teams to deliver the project on time and with high quality output.

We expect you to be 

* creative to think out of the box and prepare suggestions how to implement the project
* analytical & data driven (focus on data analysis and experiment testing)
* communicative (ideally native English)
* tech-savvy, but no need to have development skills

### Working environment

You'll be working in our office in Bangkok. We have a beautiful office here full of snacks and Coke. 27" screens and ergonomic chairs.

Our working hours are typically 10am-8pm, but it's pretty flexible. Some of us start early morning (8am), some of us start later and work until midnight.

We've got lots of fun at the office, check out what people say in the video below:

### Communication

We communicate over Slack. Sometimes even when we sit next to each other ;-) to not disturb each other when we're *in the zone.* In HipChat, each topic or project has its own room and we use mentions to notify when there's something important. Jim is also posting there some funny *.gif* images.

### Compensation

We're still small but we recognise that we need to pay well to get the talent we need. To really (I mean *REALLY*) good candidates we can offer equity.

But we offer much more to make you happy - check the [compensation packages](https://github.com/HotelQuickly/WeAreHiring/blob/master/README.md#compensation--perks).
