### About you

You're studying at a tech-university, but also freelancing or working on open-source projects.

Hopefully you'll have some published code (in any language, maybe on GitHub?) that we can take a look at.

Honestly, we don't take interns beginners.

### Why?

We believe people can and should experience last-minute traveling because all those spontaneous moments enrich our lives.

Therefore, we are serving travellers with a world-class mobile product that makes last-minute hotel booking fast and rewarding.

Do you want to help us build this product?

### Your engagement

We've got a pretty detailed plan for intern's onboarding. You'll get a mentor assigned before you start and he'll make sure you get lots of training in the first 2 weeks.

Furthermore, he'll assign you things to learn even before you start, so you'll be pretty busy anyways.

After the initial 3 weeks you'll start contributing to the ongoing development - depending on your skillset it will be either frontend, backend or mobile apps (iOS, Android, BlackBerry).

Two months after you start we'll assign you another project to work on part-time to make sure you learn as much as possible.

Please note that we don't take interns for less than 4 months. If you are from abroad, we will arrange visa for you.

### Location

You'll be working in our office in Bangkok, directly with all the other engineers and the tech co-founder. We have a beautiful office here full of snacks and Coke.

See some photos [in our gallery](https://plus.google.com/photos/100392005626903871747/albums/6014406468923735649).

Our working hours are typically 10am-8pm, but it's pretty flexible. Some of us start early morning (8am), some of us start later and work until midnight.

### Communication

We communicate over HipChat. Sometimes even when we sit next to each other ;-) to not disturb each other when we're *in the zone.* In HipChat, each topic or project has its own room and we use mentions to notify when there's something important. Jim is also posting there some funny *.gif* images.

### Compensation

You'll learn a lot and we don't expect you to pay for that. We'll not pay you either unless you are an **intern superstar.**
