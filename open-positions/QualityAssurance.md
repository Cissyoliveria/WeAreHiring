# Quality Assurance manager & tester

### About us

[HotelQuickly](http://www.hotelquickly.com) is the #1 mobile app for same-day hotel booking in Asia-Pacific with great last-minute discounts. Our company was set up by experienced [international team](http://www.hotelquickly.com/about-us) comprising of serial entrepreneurs and investors. We launched across Asia in March 2013 with teams in Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, Indonesia and Malaysia. Now we're live in 12 countries across Asia-Pacific.

Recently we were featured on TechCrunch, CBS, NBC, e27, TechInAsia, TheNextWeb, Yahoo, Tnooz and [zillions of others](http://www.hotelquickly.com/press).

Oh, and we raised $4.5m USD in [last funding](http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/09/hotelquickly-raises-4-5-million-to-double-down-on-last-minute-hotel-booking-in-asia-pacific/). That makes it $5.6M in total. So let's help us make this company HUGE!

**We are looking for a QA manager & tester who wants to help us to create an outstanding product.**

### About you

You've worked on several projects as a QA and our initial assignments during the [interview process](https://github.com/HotelQuickly/WeAreHiring/blob/master/README.md#hiring-process) will be a walk in a park for you ;-)

Honestly, we don't really care about your level of formal education, math skill, and so on. We want to see that you know the shit.

You want to be a part of a team creating a world-class application and creatively contribute to ongoing development by improving the processes and making *everything* more stable.

### The job and the challenges

We expect you to take ownership of the QA for all our projects (currently 60+ repositories in GitHub). That means you should be

* watching trends and best practices in QA
* reading blogs and compiling ideas how to improve testing of our mobile apps, Backend and Frontend
* able to quicky test builds that are about to be released
* able to work in a team with developers making sure they see bug-free code as a priority, too

On a more technical note, you need to be able to handle

* API testing (we have lots of APIs used by mobile applications and our internal projects)
* database testing (we use MySQL procedures)
* mobile application testing (we have Android, BlackBerry and iOS apps)
* functional testing (especially for Backend and Extranet)
* automated tests (we're experimenting with TestObject)
* server load tests (some of our servers need to be scaled to handle ~1000 requests per second)
* system integration tests (we have almost 20 servers communicating with each other)
* version control repositories (preferably ```git```)
* and to create test plans based on release schedule

In other words, QA of all our projects will be in your hands and you'll need to manage it.

### Location

You'll be working in our office in Bangkok, directly with all the other engineers and the tech co-founder. We have a beautiful office here full of snacks and Coke.

See some photos [in our gallery](https://plus.google.com/photos/100392005626903871747/albums/6014406468923735649).

Our working hours are typically 10am-8pm, but it's pretty flexible. Some of us start early morning (8am), some of us start later and work until midnight.

### Communication

We communicate over HipChat. Sometimes even when we sit next to each other ;-) to not disturb each other when we're *in the zone.* In HipChat, each topic or project has its own room and we use mentions to notify when there's something important. Jim is also posting there some funny *.gif* images.

### Compensation

We're still small but we recognise that we need to pay well to get the talent we need. To really (I mean *REALLY*) good candidates we can offer equity.

But we offer much more to make you happy - check the [compensation packages](https://github.com/HotelQuickly/WeAreHiring/blob/master/README.md#compensation--perks).

### More info

There's lots of additional resources in

* [README.md](https://github.com/HotelQuickly/WeAreHiring/blob/master/README.md)
