### About us

[HotelQuickly](http://www.hotelquickly.com) is the #1 mobile app for same-day hotel booking in Asia-Pacific with great last-minute discounts. Our company was set up by experienced [international team](http://www.hotelquickly.com/about-us) comprising of serial entrepreneurs and investors. We launched across Asia in March 2013 with teams in Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, Indonesia and Malaysia.

Recently we were featured on TechCrunch, CBS, NBC, e27, TechInAsia, TheNextWeb, Yahoo, Tnooz and [zillions of others](http://www.hotelquickly.com/press).

Oh, and we raised $1.1m USD from various investors in Asia, Europe and the U.S. So let's help us make this company HUGE!

**We are looking for an Android developer who wants to help us to create an outstanding mobile application.**

### About you

You've built several Android applications and our initial assignments during the [interview process](https://github.com/HotelQuickly/WeAreHiring/blob/master/README.md#hiring-process) will be a walk in a park for you ;-)

Hopefully you'll have some published code (in any language, maybe on GitHub?) that we can take a look at.

Honestly, we don't really care about your level of formal education, math skill, and so on. We want to see that you know the shit.

You want to develop a world class Android application and creatively contribute to ongoing development.

### The job and the challenges

We expect you to take ownership of the Android application. That means you should be

* watching trends and best practices in Android development
* reading blogs and compiling ideas how to improve our app
* going for Android-related meetups in Bangkok discussing some of the recent challenges and how to handle them
* getting feedback about the app from users wherever you go and making sure it's implemented
* able to quicky implement things requested by business / sales
* able to work in a team with other Android developers

On a more technical note, you need to know how to handle the entire software development life cycle, end to end, including working with

* webviews
* push notifications
* 2D animations
* i18n
* caching & pre-loading
* local storage
* JSON APIs
* version control repositories (preferably ```git```)

### Location

You'll be working in our office in Bangkok, directly with all the other engineers and the tech co-founder. We have a beautiful office here full of snacks and Coke.

See some photos [in our gallery](https://plus.google.com/photos/100392005626903871747/albums/6014406468923735649).

Our working hours are typically 10am-8pm, but it's pretty flexible. Some of us start early morning (8am), some of us start later and work until midnight.

### Communication

We communicate over HipChat. Sometimes even when we sit next to each other ;-) to not disturb each other when we're *in the zone.* In HipChat, each topic or project has its own room and we use mentions to notify when there's something important. Jim is also posting there some funny *.gif* images.

### Compensation

We're still small but we recognise that we need to pay well to get the talent we need. To really (I mean *REALLY*) good candidates we can offer equity.

But we offer much more to make you happy - check the [compensation packages](https://github.com/HotelQuickly/WeAreHiring/blob/master/README.md#compensation--perks).

### How to apply?

Do you want to enjoy some fun while working with us? Then check next steps in our [hiring process](https://github.com/HotelQuickly/WeAreHiring/blob/master/README.md#hiring-process). RTFM and apply.

*No brogrammers / ninjas / rockstars, please.*
