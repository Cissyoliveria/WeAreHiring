# Server admin & release manager

### About us

[HotelQuickly](http://www.hotelquickly.com) is the #1 mobile app for same-day hotel booking in Asia-Pacific with great last-minute discounts. Our company was set up by experienced [international team](http://www.hotelquickly.com/about-us) comprising of serial entrepreneurs and investors. We launched across Asia in March 2013 with teams in Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, Indonesia and Malaysia. Now we're live in 12 countries across Asia-Pacific.

Recently we were featured on TechCrunch, CBS, NBC, e27, TechInAsia, TheNextWeb, Yahoo, Tnooz and [zillions of others](http://www.hotelquickly.com/press).

Oh, and we raised $4.5m USD in [last funding](http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/09/hotelquickly-raises-4-5-million-to-double-down-on-last-minute-hotel-booking-in-asia-pacific/). That makes it $5.6M in total. So let's help us make this company HUGE!

**We are looking for a server admin and release manager who wants to help us to create an outstanding product.**

### About you

You've managed lots of servers and our initial assignments during the [interview process](https://github.com/HotelQuickly/WeAreHiring/blob/master/README.md#hiring-process) will be a walk in a park for you ;-)

Honestly, we don't really care about your level of formal education, math skill, and so on. We want to see that you know the shit.

### The job and the challenges

* You'll help us manage PuppetLabs for deployment management
* Schedule and apply OS patches and upgrades, configure and add new services as necessary
* Develop, review, and execute scripts to backup and recover test datasets
* Work with infrastructure team on environment design, configuration and deployment scheduling
* Recommend process enhancements to improve the accuracy and quality of measurements and targets
* Work with Development to design and implement code branching strategy for easier deployment

### Location

You'll be working in our office in Bangkok, directly with all the other engineers and the tech co-founder. We have a beautiful office here full of snacks and Coke.

See some photos [in our gallery](https://plus.google.com/photos/100392005626903871747/albums/6014406468923735649).

Our working hours are typically 10am-8pm, but it's pretty flexible. Some of us start early morning (8am), some of us start later and work until midnight.

### Communication

We communicate over HipChat. Sometimes even when we sit next to each other ;-) to not disturb each other when we're *in the zone.* In HipChat, each topic or project has its own room and we use mentions to notify when there's something important. Jim is also posting there some funny *.gif* images.

### Compensation

We're still small but we recognise that we need to pay well to get the talent we need. To really (I mean *REALLY*) good long-term candidates we can offer equity.

But we offer much more to make you happy - check the [compensation packages](https://github.com/HotelQuickly/WeAreHiring/blob/master/README.md#compensation--perks).
