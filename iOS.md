**We are looking for an iPhone developer who wants to help us to create an outstanding mobile application.**

** About you **

You want to develop a world class iPhone application and creatively contribute to ongoing development.

Hopefully you'll have some published code (in any language, maybe on GitHub?) that we can take a look at.

We don't really care about your level of formal education, math skill, and so on. We want to see that you know your stuff.

You've built several iOS applications and our initial assignments during the interview process will be a walk in a park ;-)

** The job and the challenges **



** Location **

Our headquarters including the full engineering team is in Bangkok. We have a beautiful office here full of snacks and Coke.

Our working hours are typically 10am-8pm, but it's pretty flexible. Some of us start early morning (8am), some of us start later and work until midnight.

** Compensation **

We're still small but we recognise that we need to pay well to get the talent we need. To really (I mean REALLY) good candidates we can offer equity.

But we offer much more to make you happy - check the [compensation packages](https://github.com/HotelQuickly/WeAreHiring/blob/master/compensation/compensation-package.md).

** How to apply **

PS: No brogrammers / ninjas / rockstars, please.
