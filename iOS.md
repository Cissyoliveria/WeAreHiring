**We are looking for an iOS developer who wants to help us to create an outstanding mobile application.**

### About you

You want to develop a world class iPhone application and creatively contribute to ongoing development.

Hopefully you'll have some published code (in any language, maybe on GitHub?) that we can take a look at.

We don't really care about your level of formal education, math skill, and so on. We want to see that you know your stuff.

You've built several iOS applications and our initial assignments during the interview process will be a walk in a park ;-)

### The job and the challenges

### Location

You'll be working in our office in Bangkok, directly with all the other engineers and the tech co-founder. We have a beautiful office here full of snacks and Coke.

Our working hours are typically 10am-8pm, but it's pretty flexible. Some of us start early morning (8am), some of us start later and work until midnight.

### Communication

We communicate over HipChat. Sometimes even when we sit next to each other ;-) to not disturb each other when we're *in the zone.* In HipChat, each topic or project has its own room and we use mentions to notify when there's something important. Jim is also posting there some funny *.gif* images.

### Compensation

We're still small but we recognise that we need to pay well to get the talent we need. To really (I mean REALLY) good candidates we can offer equity.

But we offer much more to make you happy - check the [compensation packages](https://github.com/HotelQuickly/WeAreHiring/blob/master/compensation/compensation-package.md).

### How to apply?

The full hiring process is [described here](https://github.com/HotelQuickly/WeAreHiring/blob/master/README.md#hiring-process). RTFM and apply.

PS: No brogrammers / ninjas / rockstars, please.
